# GANs
Generative adversarial network

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are deep neural networks architectures comprised of two neural networks, in competition with one another (therefore the terminology “adversarial”).

GANs were introduced in a paper by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including Yoshua Bengio, in 2014. Referring to GANs, Facebook’s AI research director Yann LeCun called adversarial training “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML.”

GANs’ potential is huge, because they can learn to mimic any distribution of data. That is, GANs can be taught to create worlds similar to our own in any domain: images, music, speech, prose. They are robot artists in a sense, and their output is impressive.

One notable example is the website ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com which creates an endless stream of fake portraits. The algorithm behind it is trained on a huge dataset of real images, then uses a generative adversarial network (or GAN) to fabricate new examples.
